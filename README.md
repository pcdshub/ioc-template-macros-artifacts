## ioc-template-macros-artifacts

This repository stores the test artifacts used by ioc-template-macros.

This is kept separate and referenced as a submodule because this contains
around 10k files, and cloning this onto NFS takes about two minutes.

Maintaining a separate submodule allows us to clone ioc-template-macros
and work on the code without necessarily needing to handle these 10k files.

The files are generated by running the `generate_artifacts.py` script,
which copies the files out from their filesystem locations.
